# Family-Chore-Planner

## Description

An app designed for modern families. Our full stack solution empowers parents and children alike to effortlessly manage household chores and earnings. Parents can easily create a secure profile, assigning unique logins and passwords. Once logged in, set personalized goals for your child to save towards.

### USER STORY

As a parent and child, I want to keep track of household chores and money earned for completing chores.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- GIVEN a full stack program that accepts user input
- WHEN a parent creates a login and password
- THEN the program will create a profile to store child and the goal the child is saving for 
- WHEN a parent creates a chore
- THEN the parent will be able to assign the chore to a child and set a value for completion
- WHEN the user opens the application on a mobile screen
- THEN they are presented with a responsive UI
- WHEN the child visits their dashboard
- THEN they are able to see their progress and how much money they have earned

Through this program we learned how to make a full stack MERN program from scratch. We learned to pass data from our database in the back-end to the front-end, we learned how to create schemas, models, and resolvers. Our motivation for this project was to create an app to help bring financial literacy to children and make saving and financial goal setting fun.
